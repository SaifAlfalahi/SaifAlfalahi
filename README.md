I am a Computer Science student with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems.

## Objective

With a profound passion for software engineering and a demonstrated track 
record of successful projects.My work ranges from managing the development of an intuitive university E-Advising website as my senior project, to leading the creation of an electronic system designed to replace traditional paper- 
logbooks in the College of Health Sciences at the University of Sharjah. These 
projects not only prove my technical proficiency, particularly in software development, but also highlight my ability to lead and inspire a team towards creating software solutions that significantly improve user interactions.
